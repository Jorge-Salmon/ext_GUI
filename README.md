# ext_GUI
A GUI that calculates optical extinction of a gold nanoparticle as a function of size with Mie Theory.

Mie scattering theory is the generalized solution that describes the scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a homogeneous spherical medium having RI different from that of the medium through which the wave is traversing. It is worth reiterating that Mie scattering is not any independent physical phenomenon. It is only a definite solution to the Maxwell's equations for the multipole radiation due to the electric polarization of the molecules in the scattering particles when an electromagnetic wave is incident upon it. It gives the solutions for scattering where the phase of the incident signal can even change considerably within the dimension of the scattering particle. Therefore, unlike Rayleigh scattering, it does not require the condition of 2πd/λ ≪ 1 to be fulfilled. Dust, smoke, rain drop particles are common causes of scattering to propagating waves following the Mie solution.

The GUI was created using PyMieScatt and Kivy.
